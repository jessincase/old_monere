To DO:
- Fix CSS and HTML. 
- Start chatting button
- Menu dropdown leads to chatroom created by user.
- Limit chat to 5 people only. But people can read?? Possibly dunno. 
- boards url shouldn’t be numbers but the actual category. slugs.
- Fix post feed. Make it more aesthetic. Title on top. Description below. 
- Description can upload video. Article. Photo. Then display it.
- In Chatroom, the object of thing is seen in chat. Maybe displayed on side.  

To fix:
- Fix timestamp and change to local Sydney time.
- Create users in chat system. Write a test for it.
- Page size should remain the same. After 15 messages, you can scroll up and down. When messages are added, previous messages on top should disappear. 
- Just rewrite html and css. 


IMPORTANT:
- Make a profile page. 
- When you click on post, it expands. Also a button “chat”
- Create a page for displaying user rooms.
- Change HTML and CSS. Use React perhaps? Instead of using tables, display a series of posts and comments? 
- Once a post button is clicked, chat is added to your sidebar. You have the option of saving it. And unsaying. 
- Sidebar is separated into saved and current. 

To do:
Separate messages by other users and you.
