To DO:
REFACTOR
- Seperate into server side and client side. Use React for client side and in the meanwhile refactor server side.
- Clean up requirements list.

Server Side
- Create a more robust user management system. Have createUser, updateUser, changePassword, deleteUser, changeUsername?

Client Side
- Use ReactJS so set up. Install node.js maybe webpack?
-
